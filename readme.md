# Chinchilla Scratch Game
This is my Project 0 for CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science, Harvard University). The task was to create a game using Scratch.

## Getting Started

In order to play the game:

1. You can download the game file (chinchilla.sb3) to your local computer and open it on this website: https://scratch.mit.edu/, or
2. Go to: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/333429540 and enjoy!

How to play:

* Here you have a chance to become a chinchilla! Use <kbd>&rightarrow;</kbd> and <kbd>&leftarrow;</kbd> arrow keys to move the chinchilla left and right and <kbd>space</kbd> to jump.
* You gain points for every red apple you collect and you lose points for every gold one.
* There is also a blue ball you have to watch out for - if you touch it, you lose the game.
* In order to win, you need to collect 20 apples.

**NOTE:**
In real life, chinchillas should not eat apples. Both dried and fresh fruit contain a lot of sugar which is bad for chinchillas and may increase the risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes.
